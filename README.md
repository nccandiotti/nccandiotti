### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicole!

Software Engineer (in the making) with experience using JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I also hold a bachelors degree from New York University ðŸ’œ and a masters degree from Columbia University ðŸ‘‘ in Communication Sciences and Disorders ðŸ—£ . Prior to delving into coding, I worked as a medical speech-language pathologist. I hope to blend these areas of study and collaborate with others to create accessible technology, particularly for individuals with brain injuries ðŸ§ , their caregivers, and medical providers ðŸ©º. 

When I'm not coding, I love street photography (currently using a FUJI XT2 ðŸ“¸) and am a true Francophile, j'habitais Ã  Paris il y a quelques ans ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Happy to have you here :)
