### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicole :) 

Software Engineer (in the making) with experience using JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I also hold a bachelors degree from New York University and a masters degree from Columbia University in communication sciences and disorders. Prior to delving into coding, I worked as a medical speech-language pathologist. I hope to blend these areas of study and collaborate with others to create accessible technology, particularly for individuals with brain injuries, their caregivers, and medical providers. 

Happy to have you here :)
