### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Nicole!

Software Engineer (in the making) with experience using JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I also hold a bachelors degree from New York University ğŸ’œ and a masters degree from Columbia University ğŸ‘‘ in Communication Sciences and Disorders ğŸ—£ . Prior to delving into coding, I worked as a medical speech-language pathologist. I hope to blend these areas of study and collaborate with others to create accessible technology, particularly for individuals with brain injuries ğŸ§ , their caregivers, and medical providers ğŸ©º. 

When I'm not coding, I love street photography (currently using a FUJI XT2 ğŸ“¸) and am a true Francophile, j'habitais Ã  Paris il y a quelques ans ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·

Happy to have you here :)
